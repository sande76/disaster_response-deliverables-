## 3. Algorithms

### XGBoost
- Level-wise gradient boosted trees; industry standard for tabular data.
- Regularisation via `reg_alpha`, `reg_lambda`, `gamma` prevents overfitting.
- `hist` tree method for fast training on 300k+ row datasets.
- Native `sample_weight` support for class imbalance.

### LightGBM
- Leaf-wise growth finds complex non-linear patterns ~3x faster than XGBoost.
- Built-in `class_weight='balanced'` for additional imbalance protection.
- Excellent at capturing granular weather-disaster correlations.

### Soft-Voting Ensemble (Production Model)
- Loads both tuned XGBoost and LightGBM sub-models.
- For each Day horizon, averages the class probability arrays (50/50).
- `argmax` of averaged probabilities gives the final prediction.
- Reduces model variance: if one model is overconfident, the other tempers it.
- No extra training required — assembled post-hoc from tuned sub-models.

## 4. Handling Class Imbalance

Disaster severity is heavily skewed towards `Normal` (~75-85% of rows).
We applied a **multi-layer defence strategy**:

| Technique | Effect |
|---|---|
| `compute_sample_weight('balanced')` on XGBoost/LightGBM | Penalises misclassifying rare Extreme/Severe events |
| `class_weight='balanced'` in LightGBMclassifier | Additional internal balancing |
| Temporal validation split | No future leakage; realistic evaluation |
| Optuna objective on Day+1 Accuracy | Directly optimises the primary horizon |

> **Why NOT SMOTE?** SMOTE generates synthetic rows by interpolating between samples.
> For time-series climate data this breaks temporal continuity and causes data leakage.
> Sample weighting is the correct, leak-free alternative.

---

## 5. Evaluation Metrics Explained

| Metric | Why Use It | Limitation |
|---|---|---|
| **Accuracy** | Simple % of correct predictions | Misleading with skewed data (80% by always predicting Normal) |
| **F1-Macro** | Equal weight to all classes including rare Extreme | Primary metric for disaster models |
| **F1-Weighted** | Weighted by class frequency; realistic overall score | Favours dominant Normal class |
| **QWK (Quadratic Weighted Kappa)** | Penalises predictions by ordinal distance from truth | Best for ranked severity classes |
| **Exact Match** | All 3 future days must be exactly correct simultaneously | Strictest end-to-end metric |

> **Recommended primary metric:** F1-Macro on Day+1 (most actionable horizon).
> **Recommended secondary:** QWK on Day+1 (ordinal error awareness).

## 6. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optuna)

Optuna uses **Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE)** to intelligently search the
hyperparameter space — far more efficient than grid search or random search.

| Parameter | Search Range (XGBoost) | Best Found |
|---|---|---|
| `n_estimators` | 100 – 500 | 250 |
| `max_depth` | 3 – 10 | 10 |
| `learning_rate` | 0.01 – 0.30 | 0.1206 |
| `subsample` | 0.50 – 1.00 | 0.7993 |
| `colsample_bytree` | 0.50 – 1.00 | 0.578 |
| `reg_alpha` | 0 – 2 | 1.7324 |
| `reg_lambda` | 0.5 – 5 | 3.205 |

| Parameter | Search Range (LightGBM) | Best Found |
|---|---|---|
| `n_estimators` | 100 – 500 | 126 |
| `num_leaves` | 20 – 150 | 144 |
| `learning_rate` | 0.01 – 0.30 | 0.2669 |
| `min_child_samples` | 5 – 100 | 14 |
| `reg_alpha` | 0 – 2 | 1.3685 |
| `reg_lambda` | 0 – 5 | 2.2008 |

## 9. Model Recommendation

| Consideration | XGBoost | LightGBM | Ensemble |
|---|---|---|---|
| Validation Accuracy | Best | Moderate | Good |
| F1-Macro (Rare Events) | Best single model | Lower | Balanced |

## 12. How Probabilistic Predictions Are Calculated

This section explains the complete mechanism by which the system converts raw weather measurements into a probability score for each severity class, for each of the 3 future days.

### 12a. From Raw Features to Class Probabilities

Each individual model (XGBoost / LightGBM) is a **multi-class classifier** trained on 4 classes:

| Class Integer | Label    | Meaning                                      |
|---|---|---|
| 0             | Normal   | No significant disaster risk                 |
| 1             | Moderate | Minor risk — localised impact possible       |
| 2             | Severe   | High risk — widespread impact expected       |
| 3             | Extreme  | Emergency level — immediate response needed  |

When you call `model.predict_proba(X)` on a single model (XGBoost or LightGBM), it returns:

```
For each of the 3 forecast days → a 4-element probability vector
[P(Normal), P(Moderate), P(Severe), P(Extreme)]
```

These 4 values always sum to 1.0. For example:

```
Day+1 output: [0.08, 0.14, 0.47, 0.31]
              Normal Mod  Severe Extreme
              → Predicted class = Severe (argmax = index 2)
              → P(any disaster) = 0.14 + 0.47 + 0.31 = 0.92 (92%)
```

---

### 12b. Soft-Voting Ensemble Probability Averaging

The `SoftVotingEnsemble` combines the two individual models by **averaging their probability arrays** — this is what "soft voting" means:

```python
def predict_proba(self, X):
    xgb_proba  = self.xgb_model.predict_proba(X)   # List of 3 arrays, one per day
    lgbm_proba = self.lgbm_model.predict_proba(X)  # List of 3 arrays, one per day

    for each day horizon:
        ensemble_proba[day] = (xgb_proba[day] + lgbm_proba[day]) / 2.0
```

**Why averaging probabilities is better than majority vote:**

| Method | How it works | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| Hard voting | Each model votes for a class; majority wins | Loses confidence information |
| **Soft voting** | Average the probability arrays; take argmax | Preserves uncertainty; reduces overconfidence |

**Concrete example — Flood prediction for a high-rain day:**

| Model | P(Normal) | P(Moderate) | P(Severe) | P(Extreme) | → Predicted |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| XGBoost  | 0.05 | 0.10 | 0.30 | **0.55** | Extreme |
| LightGBM | 0.03 | 0.22 | **0.45** | 0.30 | Severe |
| **Ensemble** | **0.04** | **0.16** | **0.375** | **0.425** | → **Extreme** |

The ensemble averages the arrays: `(0.55 + 0.30) / 2 = 0.425` for Extreme,
`(0.30 + 0.45) / 2 = 0.375` for Severe. Argmax = Extreme, but with lower
overconfidence than XGBoost alone — this is the key variance reduction benefit.

---

### 12c. Final Prediction vs Probability Output

```python
# Severity class label (what you show on a map):
predictions = ensemble.predict(X)
# Returns shape (n_rows, 3) — one column per forecast day
# Each value is 0/1/2/3 → decode with {0:'Normal', 1:'Moderate', 2:'Severe', 3:'Extreme'}

# Continuous probability (for risk scoring, thresholds, alerts):
proba_list = ensemble.predict_proba(X)
# Returns a Python list of 3 numpy arrays:
#   proba_list[0] → shape (n_rows, 4) for Day+1
#   proba_list[1] → shape (n_rows, 4) for Day+2
#   proba_list[2] → shape (n_rows, 4) for Day+3

# Example: P(any non-Normal event) for Day+1:
flood_risk_prob_day1 = proba_list[0][:, 1:].sum(axis=1)
# = P(Moderate) + P(Severe) + P(Extreme), range 0.000 to 1.000

# Example: Population-weighted Risk Score:
risk_score = flood_risk_prob_day1 * division_population
```

## 13. Test Data — What Data Was Used and How

### 13a. Test Period & Size

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| **File** | `Dataset Separation/test_data.csv` |
| **Period** | 2024-01-01 to 2025-12-31 (2 full years) |
| **Rows** | 88,209 rows after feature engineering |
| **Divisions** | All 121 Sri Lankan Divisional Secretariats |
| **Data Source** | Open-Meteo API (same source as training, future period) |
| **Training overlap** | Zero — models trained on 2015–2023 only |

### 13b. How Test Features Are Constructed

The same 12-feature engineering pipeline that was applied to training data is applied to test data:

```
Step 1 — Fetch from Open-Meteo API (for each division, each day 2024–2025):
    rain_sum, temperature_2m_mean,
    soil_moisture_7_to_28cm, soil_moisture_28_to_100cm, soil_moisture_100_to_255cm

Step 2 — Compute lag / rolling features (within each division separately):
    rain_lag_1       = rain_sum shifted back 1 day
    rain_rolling_3d  = sum of rain_sum over past 3 days
    rain_rolling_7d  = sum of rain_sum over past 7 days

Step 3 — Cyclical month encoding (removes the Jan=1, Dec=12 boundary discontinuity):
    month_sin = sin(2π × month / 12)
    month_cos = cos(2π × month / 12)

Step 4 — SPI (Standardised Precipitation Index):
    Fit a Gamma distribution to historical rain_sum for this division
    SPI = (observed rain − mean) / std  (normalised drought/flood indicator)

Step 5 — Division encoding:
    division_encoded = LabelEncoder(division_name) via master_division_encoder.pkl
```

### 13c. How Target Labels Are Created for Evaluation

The test data severity labels (ground truth) are created using the **same forward-shift method** as training:

```python
# Sort by division and date (chronological order)
df = df.sort_values(['division', 'date'])

# For a row representing "today", the target label is the severity N days ahead:
df['target_d1'] = df.groupby('division')['severity_col'].shift(-1)  # tomorrow
df['target_d2'] = df.groupby('division')['severity_col'].shift(-2)  # day after tomorrow
df['target_d3'] = df.groupby('division')['severity_col'].shift(-3)  # 3 days ahead
```

This means: **given today's weather, can the model predict what severity class the region will be in 1, 2, and 3 days from now?** The last 3 rows of each division are dropped (no future labels available).

### 13d. Why the Test Period Includes 2024–2025

The test set was deliberately chosen to span 2024–2025 because:

1. **Recency** — Captures recent Sri Lankan climate patterns including the 2025 Cyclone Ditwah period (Nov 2025)
2. **Climate shift** — More recent data better reflects current monsoon dynamics versus 2015-era patterns
3. **No leakage** — The model has zero knowledge of anything after Dec 2023

### 13e. Exact Match Metric Explained

The **Exact Match** metric is the strictest performance measure used:

```
Exact Match = % of rows where ALL 3 day predictions are simultaneously correct

Example:
  Actual:    [Severe, Severe, Moderate]
  Predicted: [Severe, Severe, Moderate]  → ✓ MATCH (counted)

  Actual:    [Severe, Severe, Moderate]
  Predicted: [Severe, Moderate, Moderate] → ✗ NO MATCH (Day+2 wrong)
```

A Day+1 accuracy of 88% with an Exact Match of ~35% reflects the cumulative difficulty
of correctly forecasting all 3 days simultaneously under chaotic weather dynamics.

---

## 14. Risk Score Calculation (Population-Weighted)

The final output to the disaster management dashboard is not just a severity class — it is a **Risk Score** that combines model probability with the at-risk population:

```
Risk Score = P(Severe or Extreme | Day+1) × Division Population

Where:
  P(Severe or Extreme) = proba_list[0][:, 2] + proba_list[0][:, 3]
                        = P(class=2) + P(class=3) from the ensemble

  Division Population  = loaded from division_population_map.csv
```

**Example for Colombo division on a high-risk day:**

| Component | Value |
|---|---|
| P(Severe) | 0.37 |
| P(Extreme) | 0.41 |
| **P(Disaster)** | **0.78** |
| Colombo Population | ~752,993 |
| **Risk Score** | **586,934** (people at risk) |

Divisions are then ranked by Risk Score to prioritise emergency response allocation.
